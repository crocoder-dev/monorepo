It's really hard to test your programming knowledge after you have completed a tutorial or a lecture. We have prepared some exercises to help out beginner devs to solidify their understanding of **callbacks**. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting code, links to relevant MDN docs, and expected results. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at the solution.

If you need some additional help, you can check out our [Functions video](https://youtu.be/VkjE7CebnPQ) from the **#lockdown learning** series in which we discuss **functions and callbacks** or contact the author of the article directly.

**Callbacks** are a critical concept in **JavaScript** and you won't get very far without knowing how to use them. They are often as confusing to experienced developers as well as to beginners. A **callback** is nothing more than a function that is passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.

They are so common in **JavaScript**, you certainly used **callbacks** without knowing what they were called. You probably wrote a similar snippet multiple times:

export default (props) => <BlogLayout meta={meta} {...props}>{props.children}</BlogLayout>;
