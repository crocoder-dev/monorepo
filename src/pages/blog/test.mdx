    "Placing a lot of effort into creating a unique, modern, and easy-to-use UX / UI is crucial for branding your product. Often companies can't justify spending a similar effort to build internal component libraries. Danica Pivalica Abram argues in the article that companies should reconsider their stance because it's seriously hurting their brand.",

  abstract:
    "Good design means doing good business - it shows credibility, facilitates trust, and makes the user feel involved. UX / UI also creates and maintains the ever-so-important promise of a brand. Design systems and component libraries reduce duplication, improve cross-team collaboration, drive product scalability, and make UI consistent. There are arguments popular in the developer community that diminish the value of building an internal component library and in favor of using third-party component libraries. Third-party component libraries constrain your development team in multiple different ways. Often when there is a problem your development team cannot solve, issues will spill into the design team, forcing them to rethink their proposed design system. That creates compromises in the design and damages the perception of the product brand. Only by building your own component library will you possess enough flexibility to ensure the components used to shape your product match the design system specification in a way that does not damage your brand.",
