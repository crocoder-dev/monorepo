**Custom React hooks** are user-defined functions that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic and side effects from your React components. 

They let you encapsulate and share behavior between multiple components in a clean and reusable way. By using custom hooks, you can reduce the amount of code you write and make it easier to test as well as maintain your React applications.

Custom hooks can also help improve performance by allowing you to share state updates across multiple components and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
export const useMousePosition = (): [{ x: number, y: number },
React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<{ x: number, y: number }>>] => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMouseMove = (event: MouseEvent) => {
      setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
    };
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
    };
  }, []);
  return [position, setPosition];
};
// Use the hook in a component
import React from 'react';
import { useMousePosition } from './useMousePosition';
const MouseTracker: React.FC = () => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useMousePosition();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>X: {position.x}</p>
      <p>Y: {position.y}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default MouseTracker;
```

This code is a simple implementation of a custom hook in React with TypeScript. The custom hook is called **`useMousePosition`** and it returns the current mouse position on the screen, which is represented as an object with **`x`** and **`y`** properties.

The hook uses the **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** hooks from React to manage the state and side-effects of the component. The **`useState`** hook is used to create a state variable **`position`** that stores the current mouse position, and a function **`setPosition`** that updates the state.

The **`useEffect`** hook is used to add a **`mousemove`** event listener to the window. The listener updates the state with the current mouse position when the mouse moves. The **`useEffect`** hook also returns a cleanup function that removes the event listener when the component unmounts.

The custom hook is then used in a component called **`MouseTracker`** that displays the current mouse position on the screen. The component uses the **`useMousePosition`** hook to get the current mouse position, and then displays the **`x`** and **`y`** values in a **`div`** element.

Finally, the **`MouseTracker`** component is exported as the default export from the module, making it possible to import and use the component in other parts of the application.

## Simple button click tracker

You need to create a custom hook that tracks the number of clicks on a button in a React component and provides a way for the component to increment the count.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
export const useClickCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  return [count, increment] as const;
};
// Use the hook in a component
import React from 'react';
import { useClickCounter } from './useClickCounter';
const ClickCounter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, increment] = useClickCounter();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Button has been clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ClickCounter;
```

The **`useClickCounter`** custom hook uses the **`useState`** hook to keep track of the number of clicks on a button in a component. The **`useState`** hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value, and a function to update the state. In this case, the state is the **`count`** of clicks, which is initially set to 0.

The **`increment`** function is created to increment the count when the button is clicked. The function uses the **`setCount`** updater function returned by the **`useState`** hook to update the count by adding 1 to the previous count value.

The hook then returns an array that contains the **`count`** and the **`increment`** function.

The **`ClickCounter`** component imports the **`useClickCounter`** hook and calls it to get the count and increment function. The component then displays the number of clicks and uses the increment function as the **`onClick`** handler for the button.

## Next level button click tracker

Create a custom hook in React that tracks the number of times a button has been clicked and the time of the most recent click. The hook should provide two pieces of state: **`count`** and **`lastClicked`**, and it should also provide a way for the component to increment the count.

```tsx
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
interface UseClickTrackerState {
  count: number;
  lastClicked: number | null;
}
export const useClickTracker = (): [UseClickTrackerState, () => void] => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<UseClickTrackerState>({
    count: 0,
    lastClicked: null,
  });
  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setState(prevState => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1,
      lastClicked: Date.now(),
    }));
  }, [setState]);
  return [state, incrementCount];
};
```

The custom hook **`useClickTracker`** provides a way for the component to track the number of times a button has been clicked and the time of the most recent click. The hook exports an array of two elements: **`state`** and **`incrementCount`**. The **`state`** object contains two properties: **`count`** and **`lastClicked`**. **`count`** keeps track of the number of times the button has been clicked, and **`lastClicked`** keeps track of the timestamp of the most recent click.

The hook uses the **`useState`** hook to manage the state of the component. The initial state of the component is an object with **`count`** set to 0 and **`lastClicked`** set to **`null`**. The **`setState`** function is used to update the state whenever the button is clicked.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useClickTracker } from './useClickTracker';
const ButtonClickTracker: React.FC = () => {
  const [state, incrementCount] = useClickTracker();
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
      <p>Button has been clicked {state.count} times</p>
      <p>
        Last clicked at:{' '}
        {state.lastClicked ? new Date(state.lastClicked).toLocaleString() : 'Never'}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ButtonClickTracker;
```

The hook also uses the **`useCallback`** hook to ensure that the **`incrementCount`** function is only created once, even if the component is re-rendered multiple times. This can improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary functions.

The component **`ButtonClickTracker`** imports the hook and calls it using the **`useClickTracker`** hook. The hook returns an array with two elements: **`state`** and **`incrementCount`**. The component uses the **`state`** object to display the number of times the button has been clicked and the time of the most recent click. The component also uses the **`incrementCount`** function as the **`onClick`** handler for the button.
