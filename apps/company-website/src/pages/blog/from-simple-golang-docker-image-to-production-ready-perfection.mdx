Ahoy there, fellow Gophers! Welcome to our exciting Dockerizing adventure, where we'll transform a simple Golang Docker image into a production-ready masterpiece. As aspiring Docker captains, we'll navigate through increasing complexity, optimizing our images step by step. So, tighten your ship's rigging, and let's set sail!

<ContentTable tocData={props.toc} />

## A Humble Beginning

Our journey commences with a basic Golang Dockerfile:

```docker
FROM golang

WORKDIR /app 

COPY . .

RUN go mod download

CMD ["go", "run", "./main.go"]
```

In this Dockerfile, we use the official Golang base image, set the working directory to /app, copy the application files, download module dependencies using go mod download, and finally run our Golang application with go run.

## Pinning Versions and Embracing Debian 

To ensure stability and consistency, we'll pin the Golang version and switch to Debian for more robust build utilities:

```docker

# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

WORKDIR /app 

COPY . .

RUN go mod download

CMD ["go", "run", "./main.go"]
```

By specifying the Golang version, we ensure our image is built with the same version every time, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.

## Compiling for Performance

To enhance runtime performance, we'll compile the Golang application during the build stage:

```docker

# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

WORKDIR /app 

COPY . .

RUN go mod download

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
RUN go build -o web-app-golang

CMD ["./web-app-golang"]
```

By compiling the application beforehand, we eliminate the need to compile it at runtime, leading to faster startup times.

## Safeguarding with Layer Caching

To optimize caching and speed up the installation of dependencies, we'll copy only the necessary files:

```docker

# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

RUN go mod download

COPY . .

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
RUN go build -o web-app-golang

CMD ["./web-app-golang"]
```

By copying only the go.mod and go.sum files before running go mod download, we utilize Docker's caching mechanism effectively, reducing build times.

## A Two-Stage Expedition

To create a smaller and more secure image, we'll embark on a two-stage journey:

```docker

# Use separate stage for building image
# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

RUN go mod download

COPY . .

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
# We strategically add flags to statically link our binary.
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o web-app-golang

# Use separate stage for deployable image
FROM scratch

WORKDIR /

# Copy the binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/web-app-golang api-golang

CMD ["/web-app-golang"]
```

The two-stage approach allows us to build the binary in one stage and use a minimal scratch image for the deployable container. This significantly reduces the image size and eliminates any unnecessary components, making it more secure.

## Setting Sail with Environment Configurations

To configure our Golang application for various environments, we'll add environment variables and port configurations:

```docker

# Use separate stage for building image
# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

RUN go mod download

COPY . .

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
# We strategically add flags to statically link our binary.
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o web-app-golang

# Use separate stage for deployable image
FROM scratch

# Set gin mode
ENV GIN_MODE=release

WORKDIR /

# Copy the binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/web-app-golang api-golang

# Indicate expected port
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/web-app-golang"]
```

By setting environment variables like GIN_MODE=release and indicating the expected port (EXPOSE 8080), we ensure our application runs optimally in various environments.

## Anchoring with Non-Root Users

For heightened security, we'll anchor our ship with a non-root user:

```docker

# Use separate stage for building image
# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build

# Add non-root user
RUN useradd -u 1001 nonroot

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Use cache mount to speed up install of existing dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  go mod download

COPY . .

# Compile healthcheck
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o healthcheck \
  ./healthcheck/healthcheck.go

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
# We strategically add flags to statically link our binary.
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o web-app-golang

# Use separate stage for deployable image
FROM scratch

# Set gin mode
ENV GIN_MODE=release

WORKDIR /

# Copy the passwd file
COPY --from=build /etc/passwd /etc/passwd

# Copy the healthcheck binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/healthcheck/healthcheck healthcheck

# Copy the app binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/web-app-golang api-golang

# Use non-root user
USER nonroot

# Indicate expected port
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/web-app-golang"]
```

By using a non-root user (nonroot), we reduce the risk of potential security vulnerabilities.

## A Multistage Adventure with Development Delights

As we sail through development waters, we'll make our lives easier with delightful tools like "air" for hot reloading and "dlv" for debugging:

```docker

# Use separate stage for building image
# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.

FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build-base

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Use cache mount to speed up install of existing dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  go mod download

FROM build-base AS dev

# Install air for hot reload & delve for debugging
RUN go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest && \
  go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

COPY . .

CMD ["air", "-c", ".air.toml"]
```

Now, our development voyage is smoother with hot reloading and debugging on the fly!

## Raising the Production Flag

Production awaits, and we'll tighten security and optimize our deployment with a final stage:

```docker

# Use separate stage for building image
# Next, we embrace the powerful and versatile Debian base image 🐳
# This choice grants us easier access to essential build utilities and a robust development environment.
FROM golang:1.20-bullseye AS build-base

WORKDIR /app 

# We optimize our path to discovery, selecting only the files required to install dependencies. 🧭
# With this choice, we unlock the potential of better layer caching, improving our image's efficiency.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Use cache mount to speed up install of existing dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
  --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
  go mod download

FROM build-base AS dev

# Install air for hot reload & delve for debugging
RUN go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest && \
  go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

COPY . .

CMD ["air", "-c", ".air.toml"]

FROM build-base AS build-production

# Add non-root user
RUN useradd -u 1001 nonroot

COPY . .

# Compile healthcheck
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o healthcheck \
  ./healthcheck/healthcheck.go

# During this stage, we compile our application ahead of time, avoiding any runtime surprises.
# The resulting binary, web-app-golang, will be our steadfast companion in the final leg of our journey.
# We strategically add flags to statically link our binary.
RUN go build \
  -ldflags="-linkmode external -extldflags -static" \
  -tags netgo \
  -o web-app-golang

# Use separate stage for deployable image
FROM scratch

# Set gin mode
ENV GIN_MODE=release

WORKDIR /

# Copy the passwd file
COPY --from=build-production /etc/passwd /etc/passwd

# Copy the healthcheck binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build-production /app/healthcheck/healthcheck healthcheck

# Copy the app binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build-production /app/web-app-golang api-golang

# Use non-root user
USER nonroot

# Indicate expected port
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/web-app-golang"]
```

Now, our ship is battle-ready for the production storm!
