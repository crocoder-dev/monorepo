Imagine you're deep into coding, and you hit a wall. You're stuck, and no matter how hard you try, you can't find a way through. Sounds familiar, right?

So you lose hours trying to figure it out, but the wall is still not budging.

How about a different approach?

The Thrity Minute Rule: "If you're stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, it's time to ask for help."
