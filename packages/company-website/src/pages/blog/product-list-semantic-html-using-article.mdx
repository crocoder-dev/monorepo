🖥️ Did you know that adding **HTML** `<article>` can be useful while creating user-comments sections, interactive widgets or any independent item? 🖥️

For example, when you're trying to **display a product** (e.g. for an e-commerce site), an `<article>` is a nice choice because it can have its own `<header>` and `<footer>`. If you have a list of products, wrap these articles in a `<section>` element. Your website will be more accessible. 🐊

👉FYI - If you want to make a product list and you're thinking about semantic HTML, it's really good to use an article for each product and wrap them up inside a section element. 

👈 What's really nice about this approach is that you can use a `<header>` and `<footer>` inside each `<article>`, and, in case you need a link for the product, you can use one with `rel="bookmark"`. 🐊
