[Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was once the go-to tool for creating new React projects. It provided a simple and easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) for setting up a new React codebase, complete with a development server, automatic transpilation, and more. 

However, it seems that the days of CRA are numbered, with over 400 open pull requests and a lack of recent updates. 

Let me show you some alternatives to CRA that we personally use in CroCoder and that have advanced features, a more flexible and customizable development experience, and are actively maintained.

## Vite + React

Vite + React is another alternative worth considering. Vite is a lightweight development server that focuses on fast development and a minimal setup. It works with any JavaScript framework and is built around native ES modules, it's very fast in development since it doesn't bundle the code like webpack. When paired with React, it allows for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Next.js

Next.js is a popular alternative to Create React App (CRA) for creating React codebase. It is a framework for building server-rendered React applications, which means that the JavaScript code runs on the server and generates the HTML that is sent to the browser. This approach can help to improve the performance and SEO of your React application.

One of the bonus features of Next.js is its built-in support for server-rendering. This allows your application to load faster and provides a better user experience, particularly on slower networks or low-end devices. Additionally, because the HTML is generated on the server, search engines can easily crawl and index the content of your application, improving its SEO.

Next.js also includes built-in support for code splitting, which is a technique for loading only the JavaScript code that is needed for a specific page or component. This can help to improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be loaded and parsed by the browser.

Next.js also has a large and active community, with many developers sharing their experiences and solutions through online tutorials and forums, this can be very helpful for developers who are new to Next.js or who are looking for help and support with specific issues or challenges.

In summary, Next.js is a powerful and flexible alternative to Create React App for building server-rendered React applications. It provides built-in support for server-rendering, code splitting, automatic transpilation, and minification, as well as a large and active community. It's worth considering for developers looking to improve the performance, SEO and user experience of their React applications.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the death of Create React App should not be seen as a negative thing. It simply means that the community has evolved and progressed, and there are now better and more advanced tools available for building React applications.

One of the key benefits of using an alternative to Create React App is that they often provide more advanced features and capabilities. For example, Next.js offers built-in support for server-rendering, while Gatsby provides powerful image optimization and code splitting capabilities. These features can help to improve the performance and scalability of your React application, making it a better choice for production use.

Another benefit of using an alternative to Create React App is that they often have a more active and engaged community. For example, Next.js has a large and active community, with many developers sharing their experiences and solutions through online tutorials and forums. This can be incredibly valuable for developers who are new to React or who are looking for help and support with specific issues or challenges.

In summary, while Create React App may be "dead", the React ecosystem is still alive and well. There are many alternatives available that can provide an equally good or even better development experience, and it's worth considering them for your next React project. Whether you choose Next.js, Remix, vite + react, or another alternative, you can be confident that you're using a tool that is well-supported, actively maintained, and built on the latest best practices.
