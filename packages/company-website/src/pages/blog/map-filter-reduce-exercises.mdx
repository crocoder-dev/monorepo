It's really hard to test your programming knowledge after you have completed a tutorial or a lecture. We have prepared some exercises to help out beginner devs to solidify their understanding of **Map, Filter, Reduce**, and other useful array methods. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting code, links to relevant MDN docs, and expected results. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at the solution.

If you need some additional help, you can check out our [Arrays video](https://youtu.be/pkRW2RJ2LzQ) from **#lockdown learning** series in which we discuss **Map, Filter and Reduce** or contact the author of the article directly.

As a **JavaScript** developer, you will come across arrays. Arrays of numbers, arrays of objects, arrays of arrays of objects, multi-dimensional arrays, and you will need to simplify, transform or manipulate them.

You could use 'nested for loops' to solve most of the problems you will encounter, but that leaves the code hard to read and understand.

I would like to prove to you that by using **Map, Filter, and Reduce** array methods, not only will the code be more readable, but you will also be able to analyze the problem better and write the code with ease.

## Array squared

Square the value of every element in the array. Presume that you will only get numbers in the input array.

input.map(function (num) {

// or written with Arrow function
input.map((num) => Math.pow(num, 2));
```
This code defines an array called input which contains the numbers 1 through 5.
It then uses the **`map()`** method to iterate through each element of the array, which are numbers.

For each number, it applies the function passed to it, which is **`Math.pow(num, 2)`**, raising the number to the power of 2.
Then it returns the new array with the squared value of each element of the input array.

The second version is the same as the first version but it uses arrow function instead of anonymous function.

## Sum of every positive element

If the given input is an array of numbers, return the sum of all the positives ones. If the array is empty or there aren't any positive numbers, return 0.

## Numeronyms

Devs like to abbreviate everything: k8s means Kubernetes, a11y means accessibility, l10n means localization. You get the Dev numeronyms by taking the first and the last letter and counting the number of letters in between. Words that have less than 4 letters aren't abbreviated, because that would just be odd. The input is a sentence, and you should abbreviate every word that is 4 letters long or longer. There won't be any punctuation in the sentence. g2d l2k e6e

// or written with Arrow function and Conditional operator
input

```

This code defines a function called **`createNumeronym`** that takes in a word as an argument, and returns a new word consisting of the first letter, the length of the word minus 2, and the last letter of the original word.
It then takes a string input, which is "Every developer likes to mix kubernetes and javascript", split it into an array of words using **`.split(" ").`**

In order to iterate through each word in the array it uses **`.map()`**, and for each word that has a length of 4 or more characters, it calls the **`createNumeronym`** function on that word, and replaces it with the returned value. For words that are shorter than 4 characters, it keeps the original word.

Finally, it uses the **`join()`** method to join the array of modified words back into a single string.
The second version is the same as the first version but it uses arrow function and conditional operator.

## n! with Map and Reduce

If the given input is a number, you should return the factorial of that number. The factorial of a natural number n is the product of the positive integers less than or equal to n. So, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on.

## High performing students

You are given an array of objects representing a group of students, each with a name and an array of test scores. Your task is to use map, filter, and reduce to calculate the average test score for each student, and then return an array of objects containing only the students who have an average score above 90.

In this example, we first use **`map`** to iterate over the students, and for each student we use **`reduce`** to sum all of their scores and then we divide the sum by the number of scores to get the average.
Finally, we use **`filter`** to only include students who have an average score above 90.

## High Priced Product Categories

You are given an array of objects representing a collection of products, each with a name, price, and category.

```

This code is using JavaScript's **`reduce`** and **`map`** methods to process an array of products and group them by category, calculate the average price of each category, and then **`filter`** the categories that have an average price greater than 50.

It starts by using the **`reduce`** method on the array of products and an empty object as an initial accumulator. The callback function passed to **`reduce`** takes in two arguments: an accumulator object and the current product.
It then assigns the product's category to a variable category, and checks if the accumulator object already contains a key for this category. If it doesn't, it creates a new key on the accumulator object with an empty array as its value.
Then it pushes the current product into the array of the corresponding category and returns the accumulator object.

In the end, **`productsByCategory`** will be an object where each key is a category name, and the value is an array of products that belong to that category.
Next, it uses **`Object.keys(productsByCategory)`** to extract the keys (category names) of the **`productsByCategory`** object and then **`map`** method to iterate over these keys and calculate the average price of products in each category.
It calculates the sum of prices of all products in each category using **`reduce`** method and divides this sum with the number of products in that category.

Finally, it filters the categories that have an average price greater than 50 using **`filter`** method, and logs the final result to the console.

## HR VS IT Department

You are given an array of objects representing a collection of employees, each with a name, salary, and department.
